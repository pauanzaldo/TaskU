### App Evaluation

- **Story:** College students are busy, but need money for their personal needs. There are job opportunities available, but there is not enough time to dedicate 8-10 hours a week to a job.
- **Market:** College students 
- **Habit:** Daily. There are mini-tasks to get done all the time! 
- **Scope:** 
    - TASK SEARCH: Students can post a mini-job to get done. These include food delivery within campus, getting you at textbook, priting homework and bringing it to you, delivering items to someone else on campus. 
    - PROFILE VERIFICATION: Users are verified that they are college students through their college email 
    - FORM OF CONTACT: Basic personal information like phone number and email will be available so that both parties can communicate forward.

### Things we need to figure out
- we need a sign up and sign in page
- we need to store the user information -  may be using cloud services
- how to include camera feature for verification
- how to create a mini chat tab space between client and server
- We need to associate a form of payment with the app
- we might want to give users the flexibility to search for services
